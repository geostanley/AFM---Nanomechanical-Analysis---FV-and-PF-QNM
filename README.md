# Nanomechanical analysis of AFM images (Force Volume or PeakForce QNM data)

The scripts within this project analyse both force and height data rendered from various atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging modes. They were designed to nanomechanically characterise nuclear pore complexes: nanoscale pores that reside in the nuclear membrane of eukaryotic cells. The results from this work have been published and can be seen here: http://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/1/4/e201800142.

These scripts are desined to calculate nanomechanical data at the picoNewton force regime and nanometre length scale for AFM data obtained on soft, deformable samples, in solution. They therefore may be of use to atomic force microscopists or mechanobiologists working on the nanomechanical properties of biological samples. (They should also work for hard samples, in liquid or air).

The project is separated into 5 main scripts:

1. **NM_Load_Hertz_Save.m**
2. **NM_Select_Crop.m**
3. **NM_Collate.m**
4. **NM_Rotate_Average.m**
5. **NM_Figures.m**
